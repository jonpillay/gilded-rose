## Refactoring Change Log (Pillay J)

- Tests written that refect the original spec (without new feature)

- Beginning refactoring. updateQuality method is 45 lines long

- Conjured items I am planning on making a seperate class and cheking for it with the first if statement in updateQuality, removing 2 or 4 as needed and then moving to the next item in the list. As of yet, I can see no reason to make this more complex.
